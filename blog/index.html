Your city council determines whether that pothole gets fixed, whether affordable housing gets built in your neighborhood, how much you pay in utility rates, whether the park down the street gets new playground equipment, and how quickly police and fire respond to emergencies. These aren't abstract policy debates — they're the tangible conditions of your life. Yet local election turnout typically runs 15-30% of eligible voters, meaning a tiny fraction of residents are making decisions that affect everyone. Your vote in a local election has exponentially more impact than your vote in a national one. Use it.</p></div><div class="card"><h3>Chula Vista's Next Chapter: Growth Done Right</h3><p>Chula Vista is one of California's fastest-growing cities, and how we manage that growth will define our community for generations. Done right, growth brings new jobs, improved infrastructure, expanded services, and a broader tax base that benefits everyone. Done wrong, it means traffic congestion, strained schools, overdeveloped neighborhoods, and rising costs that push longtime residents out. The key is planning — making infrastructure investments before development, not after; requiring developers to contribute their fair share to parks, schools, and roads; preserving the open spaces and neighborhood character that make Chula Vista special; and ensuring that growth serves existing residents, not just developers' bottom lines.</p></div></div></div></section>
